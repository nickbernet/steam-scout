# STEAMScout

**STEAMScout** is a modern recruiting platform for high school STEM students. Built with the same idea as athlete recruitment tools like NCSA, STEAMScout allows students to showcase their skills, projects, and experience in a centralized, professional format.

## 📌 Why It Exists

I'm **Nick Bernet**, a robotics student who saw athletes getting recruited while STEM students like me had nowhere to showcase what we built.  
So I built STEAMScout — a clean, useful site where students can present real work and connect to opportunity.
